TESTED_arduino_ide_Uno.log time-stamped entries mean:

    Tested against the Arduino IDE (Uno board definition).


TESTED_on_wokwi_both_ways.log time-stamped entries mean:

    Tested against wokwi online simulator, using both the
    embedded diagram.json in the .ino file, as well as the
    same .ino file, but with the explicit diagram.json
    file loaded.

    The two json variants are normally meant to be identical,
    but updates may be overlooked, now and then.


TESTED_on_wokwi_usual.log time-stamped entries mean:

    Tested 'practically' on wokwi - according to the current
    workflow method (which is expected to change as 'ideas'
    come up.

    Meant to indicate the code is tested and runs well, and
    the diagram.json matches the code (fairly) well, with
    possible minor features unimplemented (especially where
    diagram.json advances new hardware connections that have
    no support (yet) in the code base).


None of this is to be taken as guaranteed, so much as a statement
about the general approach - it is expected to morph towards a
strong set of coding/testing/updating habits, in the development cycle.

Like all comments, if they do make sense, they do so the most, in
context in which they were written. Specifically, at that time,
place, and using the same equipment. ;)

Note: the 'buzzer' is functional in that sounds are present on
the host PC running the wokwi sim in the web browser.  Nice.

END.

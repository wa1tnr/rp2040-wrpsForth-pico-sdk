**upstream**: 9 March 2022, Version 1, by Koepel, Public Domain

Uses addressible RGB variant in **wokwi**
(no singleton dot-shaped LED's - more of a canvas)

**Just type stuff in.**

**Valid input** are simple Morse Code characters,
represented by what you type.

**Add spaces for delays** in parts of the message
to be 'sent' to the RGB array.


**TODO/wish-list**

 * Potentiometer inop
 * No buzzer or other sounds

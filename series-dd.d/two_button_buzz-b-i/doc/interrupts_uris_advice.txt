Basically, the prevailing advice (atm, not all read of course) seems
to imply that the human factor governs - interrupts on pushbuttons
not normally a great idea.

Unlike, say, a rotary encoder, with much finer timings (presumed here
in this write-up, anway) - the pushbutton switch needs to be carefully
debounced for human factors.

And so, it appears is a good candidate for a polling style rather than
an interrupt-driven style, of coding (at least for this one subsystem
of a given program running on an Arduino IDE compatible target MCU).

No harm (of course) in ignoring all that and going ahead and trying
to get interrupt-based pb debouncing (somewhat) functional. ;)

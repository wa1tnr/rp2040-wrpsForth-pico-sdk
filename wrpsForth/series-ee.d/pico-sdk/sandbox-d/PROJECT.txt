Do a compiled Forth for RPi Pico RP2040 target that
operates a 20x4 char LCD w/ 4-bit bus.

The memory.h type file will have the Forth program,
already compiled (on the host PC) and ready for the VM.

Necessary Forth primitives authored in C++ for the
RP2040 - initial platform is mbed (arduino.cc)
under platformio.

gforth compiles 'bytecode' for the Forth VM, from
recognizable Forth source code (held on the host PC).

END.
